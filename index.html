    <p>This document refines behaviors of the {{MediaDevices}} functions
    {{MediaDevices/enumerateDevices()}} and {{MediaDevices/getUserMedia()}} to
    reduce their fingerprinting surface and enable user selection of camera and
    microphone through device pickers implemented in the user agent.

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This document contains proposed extensions and modifications to the
    [[GETUSERMEDIA]] specification.</p>
    <p>New features and modifications to existing features proposed here may be
    considered for addition into the main specification post Recommendation.
    Deciding factors will include maturity of the extension or modification,
    consensus on adding it, and implementation experience.</p>
    <p>A concrete long-term goal is reducing the fingerprinting surface of
    {{MediaDevices/enumerateDevices()}} by deprecating exposure of the device
    {{MediaDeviceInfo/label}} in its results. This requires relieving
    applications of the burden of building user interfaces to select cameras and
    microphones in-content, by offering this in user agents as part of
    {{MediaDevices/getUserMedia()}} instead.</p>
    <p>Miscellaneous other smaller features are under consideration as well,
    such as constraints to control multi-channel audio beyond stereo.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Terminology</h2>
    <p>
      This document uses the definitions {{MediaDevices}}, {{MediaStreamTrack}},
      {{MediaStreamConstraints}} and {{ConstrainablePattern}}
      from [[!GETUSERMEDIA]].
      <p>The terms [=permission state=], [=request permission to use=], and
      <a data-cite="permissions">prompt the user to choose</a> are defined in
      [[!permissions]].</p>    </p>

  <section id="conformance">

  <section id="camera and microphone picker">
    <h2>In-browser camera and microphone picker</h2>
    <p>The existing {{MediaDevices/enumerateDevices()}} function exposes camera
    and microphone {{MediaDeviceInfo/label}}s to let applications build
    in-content user interfaces for camera and microphone selection. Applications
    have had to do this because {{MediaDevices/getUserMedia()}} did not offer a
    web compatible in-agent device picker. This specification aims to rectify
    that.</p>
    <p>Due to the significant fingerprinting vector caused by device
    {{MediaDeviceInfo/label}}s, and the well-established nature of the existing
    APIs, the scope of this particular effort is limited to removing
    {{MediaDeviceInfo/label}}, leaving the overall constraints-based model
    intact. This helps ensure a migration path more viable than to a
    less-powerful API.</p>
    <p>This specification augments the existing {{MediaDevices/getUserMedia()}}
    function instead of introducing a new less-powerful API to compete with it,
    for that reason as well.</p>
    <section id="new getusermedia semantics">
      <h3>getUserMedia "user-chooses" semantics</h3>
      <p>This specification introduces
      slightly altered semantics to the {{MediaDevices/getUserMedia()}}
      function called <code>"user-chooses"</code> that guarantee a picker will
      be shown to the user in cases where the user agent would otherwise choose
      for the user (that is: when application constraints do not narrow down
      the choices to a single device). This is orthoginal to permission, and
      offers a better and more consistent user experience across applications
      and user agents.
      </p>
      <p>Unfortunately, since the <code>"user-chooses"</code> semantics may
      produce user agent prompts at different times and in different situations
      compared to the old semantics, they are somewhat incompatible with
      expectations in some existing web applications that tend to call
      {{MediaDevices/getUserMedia()}} repeatedly and lazily instead of using
      e.g. <code>stream.clone()</code>.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="web compatibility">
      <h3>Web compatibility and migration</h3>
      <p>User agents are encouraged to provide the new semantics as opt-in
      initially for web compatibility. User agents MUST deprecate (remove)
      {{MediaDeviceInfo/label}} from {{MediaDeviceInfo}} over time, though specific migration strategies
      are left to user agents. User agents SHOULD migrate to offering the new
      semantics by default (opt-out) over time.</p>
      <p>Since the constraints-model remains intact, web compatibility problems
      are expected to be limited to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Sites that never migrated show e.g. "Camera 1", "Camera 2" etc.
          instead of descriptive device labels
        </li>
        <li>
          Sites with no device management strategy provoke a picker in the
          user agent every visit for users with more than a singular choice
          of camera or microphone (a feature of sorts)
        </li>

          <p>Let <var>semanticsPresent</var> be <code>true</code> if
          <var>constraints</var><code>.semantics</code> [= map/exists =],

        <li>
          <p>Replace step 6.5.1. of the {{MediaDevices/getUserMedia()}}
          algorithm in its entirety with the following two steps:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>Let <var>descriptor</var> be a {{PermissionDescriptor}}
              with its {{PermissionDescriptor/name}} member set to the permission name
              associated with <var>kind</var> (e.g. {{PermissionName/"camera"}} for
              <code>"video"</code>, {{PermissionName/"microphone"}} for <code>"audio"</code>), and,
              optionally, consider its {{DevicePermissionDescriptor/deviceId}} member set to any appropriate
              device's <var>deviceId</var>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>If the number of unique devices sourcing tracks of
              media type <var>kind</var> in <var>candidateSet</var>
              is greater than <code>1</code> and
              <var>semantics</var> is <code>"user-chooses"</code>,
              then <a>prompt the user to choose</a> a device with
              <var>descriptor</var>, resulting in provided media.
              Otherwise, <a>request permission to use</a> a
              device with <var>descriptor</var>, while considering
              all devices being attached to a live and
              <a>same-permission</a> MediaStreamTrack in the current
              [=browsing
              context=] to mean having permission status {{PermissionState/"granted"}},
              resulting in provided media.</p>
              <p><dfn>Same-permission</dfn> in this context means a
              {{MediaStreamTrack}} that required the same level of
              permission to obtain as what is being requested.</p>
              <p>When asking the user’s permission, the user agent
              MUST disclose whether permission will be granted only to
              the device chosen, or to all devices of that
              <var>kind</var>.</p>
              <p>Let <var>track</var> be the provided media, which
              MUST be precisely one track of type <var>kind</var> from
              <var>finalSet</var>. If <var>semantics</var> is
              <code>"browser-chooses"</code> then the decision of
              which track to choose from <var>finalSet</var> is up
              to the User Agent, which MAY use the value of the computed
              "fitness distance" from the <a href=
              "https://www.w3.org/TR/mediacapture-streams/#dfn-selectsettings">
              SelectSettings</a>
              algorithm, the value of <var>semanticsPresent</var>,
              or any other internally-available information about
              the devices, as inputs to its decision.
              If <var>semantics</var> is <code>"user-chooses"</code>,
              and the application has not narrowed down the choices
              to one, then the user agent MUST ask the user to make
              the final selection.</p>
              <p>Once selected, the source of the
              {{MediaStreamTrack}} MUST NOT change.</p>
              <p>User Agents are encouraged to default to or present
              a default choice based primarily on fitness distance,
              and secondarily on the user's primary or system default
              device for <var>kind</var> (when possible). User Agents
              MAY allow users to use any media source, including
              pre-recorded media files.</p>
